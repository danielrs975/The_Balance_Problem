# Project Title

Ternary Balance problem -  source code file "balance.py"

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The program is written in Python (version 3.8.2),
downloaded from https://www.python.org/downloads/

### Installing

First unzip the compressed file and run the following command ```sh python3 balance.py```. After that
you have to put a number to balance.

## Running the tests

To run the tests use the following command ```sh python3 testing.py```

### Unit tests

Test each of the function that are used to run the balance algorithm
    - ```python result_sum_two_digits()```
    - ```python ternary_sum()```
    - ```python base_10_to_base_3()```
    - ```python test_balance_number()```

### Validation tests

When you execute the program you can check that the answer is correct by checking the output on the screen, eg:


```
$ python3.8 balance.py
14
To weight 14 in right cup of balance, one needs to place the ternary weights in the left (L) and right (R) as follows:
L : 27
R : 9
R : 3
R : 1


```

## Built With

```
python3.8  --version
Python 3.8.2

```

## Versioning

Which versioning tool you use and where the version repository can be accessed

Version 2 - balance.py - Add unit tests and add bad input validations
